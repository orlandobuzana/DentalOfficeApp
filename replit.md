3. If unauthorized, redirects to Replit Auth login
4. Upon successful authentication, creates/updates user record
5. Establishes secure session with PostgreSQL storage

### Appointment Booking Flow
1. Patient selects date from interactive calendar
2. System fetches available time slots from database
3. Patient completes appointment form with treatment details
4. Backend validates and stores appointment with pending status
5. Admin can review and confirm appointments

### Content Management Flow
1. Admin accesses management panels
2. CRUD operations update database records
3. Changes immediately reflect in patient-facing views
4. File uploads handled through configured storage system
