# SmileCare Dental - Testing Guide

## Test Overview

The SmileCare Dental application includes a comprehensive test suite covering:

- **Frontend Tests** - React components, hooks, and UI validation
- **Backend Tests** - API routes, authentication, and data operations  
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflows and user journeys
- **Database Tests** - Schema validation, data integrity, and performance

## Running Tests

### Main Test Runner
```bash
# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Frontend tests only
./test-individual.sh frontend

# Backend tests only  
./test-individual.sh backend

# Integration tests only
./test-individual.sh integration

# Database tests only
./test-individual.sh database
```

## Test Architecture

### Frontend Testing
- Mock React hooks and components
- Validate form inputs and user interactions
- Test routing and navigation
- Verify authentication flows

### Backend Testing
- Mock database operations
- Test API endpoints and responses
- Validate authentication and authorization
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Mock complete user workflows
- Test API client interactions
- Validate end-to-end processes
- Test cross-component communication

### Database Testing
- Mock database operations
- Validate schema integrity
- Test data relationships
- Performance and scaling simulations

## Adding New Tests

### Frontend Test Example
```javascript
test('New component functionality', () => {
  const result = yourNewFunction();
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  expect(result.value).toBe('expected');
});
```

### Backend Test Example
```javascript
test('New API endpoint', async () => {
  const response = await mockStorage.newMethod(data);
  expect(response.id).toBeTruthy();
  expect(response.status).toBe('success');
});
```

### Integration Test Example
```javascript
test('New workflow', async () => {
  const client = new MockAPIClient();
  await client.login(credentials);
  const result = await client.request('POST', '/api/new-endpoint', data);
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
});
```

## Continuous Testing

### Watch Mode
The test runner can be configured to watch for file changes:
```bash
# Watch and auto-run tests (if nodemon is available)
nodemon --exec './run-tests.sh' --watch 'client/src/**/*' --watch 'server/**/*'
```

### Pre-commit Testing
Add to your development workflow:
```bash
# Before committing changes
./run-tests.sh
```

## Test Data

All tests use mock data and don't require:
- Real database connections
- External API keys
- Production credentials

This ensures tests run quickly and reliably in any environment.

## Test Reports

Test results are automatically saved to:
- `test-results/test-report.txt` - Detailed test report
- Console output - Real-time test results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TypeScript Compilation Errors:**
- These are often from dependency type definitions
- Don't usually affect application functionality
- Can be ignored if tests pass functionally

**Missing Dependencies:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to install packages
- Check that all required files exist

**Permission Errors:**
- Make test scripts executable: `chmod +x run-tests.sh`
- Ensure write permissions for test-results directory

### Getting Help

1. Check test output for specific error messages
2. Review the README.md for setup instructions
3. Verify environment configuration
4. Run individual test suites to isolate issues
